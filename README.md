A FLutter based Bus Reservation Application

## Getting Started

MAMS is a bus reservation application that simplifies the process of purchasing bus tickets, facilitates monthly membership pass transactions, and provides real-time bus tracking features, among others. The primary objective of MAMS is to alleviate overcrowding in cities through comprehensive data analysis. Additionally, MAMS strives to ensure a comfortable travel experience for passengers. The application also includes a Learn section, which offers valuable information to educate passengers on topics such as theft prevention and personal safety in public spaces.
